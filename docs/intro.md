# Introduction

Basic information about us and this guide!

## Who are we?

This scalability guide was formed by the community! We are open source and are open for anybody to make any changes to and update things as necessary!

## Why did you make this?

We made this because there was nothing quite like it! I was looking to expand a few of my projects and couldn't find one single place that I could go to find the information that I needed and that I wanted to know, so I thought... why not make my own?

## How did you make this?

I recently worked on another guide that also uses docuasurus, after doing a little more research, I decided to opt for it for here too. It utilises markdown for the entries which are commonly known and easy to learn even if you don't know how they work!

It's also lightweight and just * works * which is an obvious requirement haha.

Overall, this is made by the Community, for the Community!
